Whenever a machine learning model is built, we often split our data into testing and training data.  This project analyzes ways to split data meaningfully through the video game Pokemon, and potential benefits and limitations of doing so!

This project is coded in Stata and serves as a example of:
  * Foreach loops
  * Postestimation predictions
  * Relationship of Curve Commands within Stata
